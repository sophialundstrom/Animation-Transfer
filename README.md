# Animation Transfer
Python script for transfering an animation from one skeleton to another. Complete with UI.
School Assignment at BTH.

Some things to consider:
- Target skeleton must have at least as many joints as source, (if more they wont get affected in any way)
- Pretty slow script, around 4 min for the test mocap scene we examinated on
